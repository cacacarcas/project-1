                20 Washington Place Toilet
            </h2>
              <p>
                The bathroom at 20 Washington Place at the Rhode Island School of Design offers a striking, immersive experience that can best be described as both serene and somewhat overwhelming. Cloaked in rich blue tiles from floor to ceiling, the space evokes the calming aura of an oceanic retreat, yet the sheer expanse of monochrome tiles can feel slightly disorienting, like stepping into an art installation rather than a restroom. The deep hue, while aesthetically bold, creates a cool, almost sterile atmosphere, with the uniformity of the tiles giving the room a sense of both cleanliness and starkness. Still, there’s a certain charm in the boldness of the design — it feels intentional, a reflection of the school’s commitment to pushing creative boundaries, even in spaces where the function is purely utilitarian. A thoughtful blend of form and function, the bathroom strikes a balance between design ambition and practicality, offering an experience that lingers long after the visit itself.
